    <h6 class="caps">SIGN UP FOR CARPOOLING AT MICROSOFT</h6>
    <p>Slugg was designed and developed as part of the 2015 Hack the Commute hackathon. Due to Seattle's rapid urban development and population increases, we've seen the need for better mass transit options and an increased emphasis on ridesharing.</p>
    
    <h6 class="caps">HOW DOES IT WORK?</h6>
    <p>We talked to dozens of people who said that the hardest thing about carpooling was finding people to travel with at certain times. We've made that easier than cake with our mobile app. At a glance, you'll know who's leaving your work to go your neighborhood, or who's leaving your neighborhood heading to the office. </p>
